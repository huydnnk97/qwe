For the practice of week 6, I decided to create a simple reverse message application using Vue.js and testing it on codepen.io. It has the same structure as previous applications in the last weeks. In the method section of new Vue instance, I declare a function that reverses the content of a string. I also create a simple "Reverse message" button that will make the message reverse whenever we click it. For the CSS file, I add some configuration and decoration for the beauty of the web page.
